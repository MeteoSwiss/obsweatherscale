Usage
=====

To use obsweatherscale in a project::

    import obsweatherscale


To get started, check out the example scripts in the repository:

* ``example_train_script.py``: Demonstrates how to preprocess data, build a dataset, construct a model with customized mean and kernel functions, and train a GP model using toy data.
* ``example_inference_script.py``: Shows how to perform inference with a trained model to obtain prior and posterior distributions, and how to sample from the distributions.

These examples can be found in the ``obsweatherscale/examples/`` directory and provide a practical introduction to the library's core functionality.
